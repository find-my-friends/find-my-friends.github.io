# Welcome To *Find My Friends*

## üí° Project Overview  
*Making Friends at UH* is a web-based platform designed to help University of Hawai ªi students build real friendships based on shared interests, majors, and campus life.

## Community Feedback

To evaluate the usability and overall experience of *Find My Friends*, five community members from diverse backgrounds tested the application. Feedback was gathered through informal interviews and observation of how each user interacted with the platform.

### Overall Impressions
Participants appreciated the concept of connecting UH MƒÅnoa students based on shared interests, majors, and classes. Many highlighted that the clean, simple interface made the app approachable for first-time users. The green UH-themed color scheme and minimalistic layout were described as ‚Äúinviting‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy on the eyes.‚Äù

### Positive Feedback
- **Profile Creation:** Users found the profile form straightforward, with clear fields for name, major, hobbies, and bio. The one-profile-per-account limit was seen as a good feature to keep data organized.
- **Photo Uploads:** The ability to add a profile picture made profiles feel more personal and engaging.
- **Browsing Profiles:** Participants liked that they could see both default example profiles and real user profiles, giving them a feel for how the community might grow.
- **Start Chat Button:** Users found it intuitive and appreciated how it directly linked them to the chat page without extra steps.

### Areas for Improvement
- **Search & Filters:** Several participants suggested adding filters (e.g., by major, year, or hobbies) to make finding similar people faster.
- **Profile Editing:** While the ‚ÄúEdit Profile‚Äù button worked, a couple of users felt it could be more prominent.
- **Chat Features:** Some users expressed interest in enhancing the chat system with read receipts or group chat options.
- **Mobile Optimization:** While functional on mobile, a few users noted that profile cards could be resized or stacked differently for better small-screen readability.

### Conclusion

The main suggestions focused on expanding search features, improving chat functionality, and fine-tuning the mobile experience. These insights will guide future iterations of *Find My Friends* to make it even more useful and engaging for the UH community.
