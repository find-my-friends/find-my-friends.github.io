## üí° Project Overview  
*Making Friends at UH* is a web-based platform designed to help University of Hawai ªi students build real friendships based on shared interests, majors, and campus life. College can sometimes feel isolating, especially for new or transfer students‚Äîour goal is to create a safe, inclusive space where students can connect with others who share similar goals, hobbies, or academic paths.

This project is being developed as part of our computer science coursework to explore full-stack web development, user-centered design, and meaningful community-building through technology.
